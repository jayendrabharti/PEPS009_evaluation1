Question 1: Throttled Click Counter (Medium Level)
Problem Statement

You are given a button and a paragraph element.
Implement a throttled click counter using JavaScript.

Requirements

The count should increase when the button is clicked.

Only one click per second should be counted. //extra points

Any extra clicks within the same 1-second window must be ignored. // extra points

The UI should always display the correct count value.

Starter HTML
<button id="btn">Click</button>
<p id="count">0</p>

Constraints

You must use setTimeout.

You must use a closure to manage state.

Do not use global variables.

Do not use inline event handlers (onclick).

Notes

The button should remain clickable, but extra clicks should not affect the count.

The solution should demonstrate proper control over execution timing.




Question 2:Live Character Counter
Problem Statement

You are given a textarea and a paragraph element.
Write JavaScript code to implement a live character counter.

Requirements

Display the live character count as the user types.

The maximum character limit is 100.

When the character count exceeds 100, the count text should turn red.

When the count is within the limit, the color should return to normal.

Starter HTML
<textarea id="text"></textarea>
<p id="char-count">0 / 100</p>

Constraints

Use JavaScript event listeners.

Do not use inline HTML event handlers.

Update the UI dynamically.

Expected Behavior

Typing updates the count immediately.

Clearing text resets the count.

Color change reflects whether the limit is exceeded.



Question 3: Implement once() Function (Closures)
Problem Statement

Write a JavaScript function once(fn) that ensures a given function can be executed only once, regardless of how many times it is called.

Once the function has been executed for the first time, all subsequent calls should have no effect.

Expected Behavior
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

const greetOnce = once(greet);

greetOnce(); // Hello
greetOnce(); // no output
greetOnce(); // no output

Requirements

You must use a closure to track execution state.

The original function should execute only once.

Do not use global variables.

Extra calls should do nothing.

🚫 Do NOT modify the original function.

Constraints

Use plain JavaScript.

Do not use external libraries.

Keep the implementation clean and readable.
